NocoDB Mobile
---

NocoDB Mobile is a prototype Android/iOS client for [NocoDB](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb), an open-source alternative to Airtable.  
This project aims to make NocoDB's core functionality easily accessible from mobile devices.  
It is currently under development, and my immediate goals are to support the basic functionality of the Grid View feature of NocoDB and improve stability.

## Known issues and planned solutions

### Compatibility issues

At this point, NocoDB Mobile is tested with the latest version of NocoDB.  
I intend to support the latest three minor versions of NocoDB as much as possible in the future.
